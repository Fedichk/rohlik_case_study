It is really basic unreliable MVP.
There is a lot of possible improvements:

Necessary improvements :
 - null cases handling
 - exceptions handling
 - logging
 - order item proper mapping to product instead of product id
 - security
 - exceptions wrapper (proper messages in response)
 - logic to expire outdated orders
 - separate configuration instead of hardcoding
 - transactionality
 - cash
 - tests

Nice to have:
 - wider API
 - proper documentation
 - dockerization
 - integration tests
 - possibility to connect to different DBs

And many other features
